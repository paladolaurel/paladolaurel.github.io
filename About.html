			<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
				<p> My full name is Valdwin Ace G. Palado, I live Baranggay Mahogany, Butuan City.
				<br>I am 19 years old, and I'm a IT Student from Saint Joseph Institute of technology,
				<br>My first real appreciation of my photography came many years after starting. 
				<br>At first, I kept doing it because I enjoyed it, not because I showed any particular talent.
				<br>Photography became a career choice for me because it blended together my love of the
				<br>outdoors, desire to make things, and my interest in technology. By the time I was in 
				<br>college in my it became the obvious choice of my heart. I knew it was likely to be a 
				<br>marginal financial choice, but I am late teens, happy with the decision. With the 
				<br>places I've seen, the people I've met and the opportunities I've had to make a 
				<br>difference, my photography career has brought a richness to my life that I could 
				<br>never have imagined.
